# Challenge Info:
# The Portland-based Company you work for just opened two new branches.
# One is in NYC, the other in London. They need a very simple program to
# find out if the branches are open or closed. The hours of BOTH branches
# are 9am to 5pm in their own time zone
#
# Challenge Objective: Utilize datetime function to determine curent times in
# Portland, NYC, and London. Then compare branch hours to see if they're opened
# or closed.


# import datetime modues and any others to aid in time zone calculations
from datetime import date,time,datetime,dateutil
# create script to determine curent times in Portland, NYC, and London.
#Then compare branch hours to see if they're opened or closed.

#print out the three branches and whether or not they're open.
